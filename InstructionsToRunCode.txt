How to run analysis_pcap_tcp.py:
The code can be run without taking in any additional arguments. The pcap file should be able to opened 
in the python code. In the code, I passed in the parameter “assignment2.pcap” in order to open the 
provided pcap file. If this code is used to open another pcap file, changes will be need to be made to 
the port numbers. I got the port numbers that I used in my code from the output of srcports and dstports. 
Changes will also be needed if another pcap file is used, in line 29 where the name of the pcap file should go.
